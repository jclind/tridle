# About
For weeks, [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), and Wordle knockoffs have taken up more of my time than I would like to admit. And I, being a typical web developer, wondered how difficult it would be to create wordle. So one afternoon, instead of being productive I decided to make [Tridle](https://tridle.netlify.app/). Now, I didn't want to blatently copy it, so I made it Tridle insead of Wordle, 3 letter words instead of 5 letter words. Totally different I promise. Anyway... feel free to check it out or submit any issues you may find with it :)
